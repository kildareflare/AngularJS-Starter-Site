# AngularJS-Starter-Site
An example site layout for AngularJS using Grunt and Jasmine.

A work in progress that will be updated as I learn more.
Will probably evolve to include versions for other build utilities such as Gulp.

Most notable thing about this version is the splitting of the gruntfile.js into separate config files for each task.
